The current edition of our Let's Talk Open Source event tops the list of features in this newsletter. The session provided an incredible experience with meaningful discussions and practical workshops.

- [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org)
OSI initiated the open-source revolution and is now known as a leading open-source movement dedicated to protecting and developing open-source software.  It oversees aspects of open source beyond just free code, focusing on the freedoms to use, modify, and share.  They certify licenses and consider factors contributing to a healthy open-source community, such as diversity, accessibility, education, and developer/user empowerment.  The OSI is a key resource for anyone interested in the transformative power of open-source technology.

- [The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd)
The Open Source Definition (OSD) provides a core set of guidelines that determine whether software qualifies as "open source." It outlines the fundamental rights granted to users, including the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the software. This definition ensures clarity and consistency within the open-source community, establishing a shared understanding of what constitutes truly open software and serving as a foundation for collaborative development and the free exchange of ideas.

- [Licenses – Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses)
Open-source licenses are the legal instruments enabling open-source software.  They are agreements defining how software can be used, changed, and shared. The Open Source Initiative maintains a list of approved licenses that adhere to core open-source principles. These licenses empower developers to share their work while retaining some control over its use, granting users the freedom to utilize and improve software without legal concerns. They foster a clear and equitable system for sharing and collaboration.

- [Elastic Search and Open Search: The License War](https://dev.to/aws-builders/elastic-search-and-open-search-a-brief-history-of-the-license-war-52cb)
This article explores the licensing evolution of Elasticsearch. Originally open-source, changes to its licensing model raised concerns within the community. In response, Amazon forked Elasticsearch, creating OpenSearch as a truly open-source alternative. The article details the reasons behind the original licensing changes and the subsequent events leading to the OpenSearch fork.

- [Google Chrome: Market Rise](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-history-1025602/)
In 2008, Google introduced Chrome, aiming to disrupt the browser landscape dominated by Internet Explorer and Firefox. Chrome offered a faster, more modern browsing experience, focusing on web standards for compatibility and handling complex web applications efficiently.  Over time, Chrome expanded to mobile devices and even became the foundation for its own operating system.  Its widespread adoption has made Chrome the leading browser.

- [Linus Torvalds' Famous Email](https://fossbytes.com/linus-torvaldss-famous-email-first-linux-announcement/)
In 1991, Linus Torvalds sent a now-famous email announcing his work on a free operating system, describing it as a "hobby" project. This humble and informal announcement marked the beginning of the Linux movement, illustrating how a significant technological development can originate from a small, personal initiative and a willingness to share.
